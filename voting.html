  <h3>Voting matters, in theory</h3>
  <p>
    People vote for a variety of reasons: as a civic duty, as a social signal,
    as support for an ideology, etc.
    But the most fundamental reason to vote is to win elections.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2016, my brother told me that voting
    (in the perennial swing state of Pennsylvania)
    wasn't worth his time because one vote was so unlikely to change the
    election outcome.

    I don't think this argument holds water for even mildly altrustic people.
    <a href="https://80000hours.org/2016/11/why-the-hour-you-spend-voting-is-the-most-socially-impactful-of-all/">
      80,000 Hours analyzed of the efficacy of one vote</a>,
    drawing on empirical studies that claim that voting in a swing state
    has around a 1 in 10 million chance of swinging a US presidential election.
    The problem is that the arguments in these studies can be hard to parse
    and easy to ignore for reluctant voters like my brother.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to present a simple theoretical analysis that shows that voting
    matters a great deal in swing states. The crux of the analysis is this
    asymptotic claim:
  </p>
  <i>
    <b>Claim:</b> In a two-party election with n voters where the polling
    variance σ<sup>2</sup> is constant and the polling mean is 50% + kσ,
    the probability that one vote changes the outcome is
    θ(e<sup>-k<sup>2</sup>/2</sup>/k &middot; 1/n).
    In particular, if k is constant, the probability is θ(1/n).
  </i>
  <p>
    In the rest of this analysis, I consider the consequences of this claim,
    lay out my assumptions and prove the claim, and then discuss how valid
    those assumptions are.
  </p>
  <h3>Consequences</h3>
  <p>
    The outcome of an election affects the entire governed population.
    In general, this population is a superset of voters.
    In the US, most of the population are not voters:
    children, felons, and non-citizens cannot vote,
    and most eligible adults choose not to.
  </p>
    To get a lower bound for election impacts, we can consider laws like the
    Affordable Care Act and the 2017 tax cuts, neither of which would have
    passed if the the opposition held power.
    These laws reallocated hundreds of billions of dollars each and affected
    most of the country.
    They show that an election effect size of order θ(<i>n</i>) is plausible.
    Combined with our claim above, we see that the social impact of voting is
    independent of population size - if <i>k</i> is constant,
    θ(<i>n</i>/<i>n</i>) = θ(1) - and is boosted by low turnout.
  </p>
  <p>
    The exponential dependence on <i>k</i> explains the colloquial distinction
    between "swing states" and other states.
    Even when federal races are uncompetitive, though, the ballot may
    include state or local races for which a vote has high social impact.
  </p>
  <h3>Proof</h3>
  <p>
    Model the electorate as <i>n</i> independent, identically distributed
    Bernoulli random variables that vote one way with probability <i>p</i>.
    Assume that the polling yields a normally-distributed posterior for
    <i>p</i>, with mean 0.5 + <i>kσ</i> and variance <i>σ</i><sup>2</sup>.
    (Both these assumptions are clearly wrong; see below.)
  </p>
  <p>
    If <i>p</i> is exactly 0.5, then the probability that a vote changes the outcome -
    that is, the probability of an even split between the two parties -
    is just (<i>n</i> C <i>n</i>/2)/2<sup><i>n</i></sup>.
    By Stirling's approximation, this expression is θ(1/&Sqrt;<i>n</i>).
  <p>
    How large can <i>ε</i> get such that this asymptotic
    bound still holds for <i>p</i> in [0.5 - <i>ε</i>, 0.5 + <i>ε</i>]?
    The probability of an even split when <i>p</i> = 0.5 + <i>ε</i> is:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr><td> </td><td>(<i>n</i> C <i>n</i>/2) &middot; (0.5 + <i>ε</i>)<sup><i>n</i>/2</sup>(0.5 - <i>ε</i>)<sup><i>n</i>/2</sup></td></tr>
    <tr><td>=</td><td>(<i>n</i> C <i>n</i>/2) &middot; (0.25 - <i>ε</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup><i>n</i>/2</sup></td></tr>
    <tr><td>=</td><td>(<i>n</i> C <i>n</i>/2)/2<sup><i>n</i></sup> &middot; (1 - 4<i>ε</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup><i>n</i>/2</sup></td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    As long as <i>ε</i> &le; 1/&Sqrt;<i>n</i>, the term on the right is θ(1)
    and the whole expression is θ(1/&Sqrt;<i>n</i>). The probability that
    <i>p</i> falls into this narrow range is roughly
    <i>N</i>(0, <i>σ</i>)(<i>k</i>) &middot; 2/&Sqrt;<i>n</i>,
    since for constant σ the probability density is roughly equal
    over the entire interval.
    Multiplying by θ(1/&Sqrt;<i>n</i>) and expanding the normal distribution's
    density gives us our claim.
  </p>
  <h3>Validity</h3>
  <p>
    The proof above assumes that the electorate is composed of identical
    voters who vote randomly on the day of the election.
    In truth, voters make their decisions far in advance and different
    segments of the electorate behave very differently.
    Most randomness in the election result comes from whether or not different
    voters turn out to vote.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason that these assumptions are teneble is because the result still
    holds as long as the aggregate random variable of "the number of votes for
    one side" behaves like a sum of <i>n</i> Bernoulli variables.
    By the Central Limit Theorem, this sum is asymptotically normally
    distributed with mean <i>np</i> and variance <i>np</i>(1-<i>p</i>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, weaker assumptions that are sufficient for the claim are:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The overall vote count for each side is normally distributed.</li>
    <li>The variance of this vote count is of order θ(<i>np</i>(1-<i>p</i>)) ~ θ(<i>n</i>).</li>
    <li>Polling gives us normally distributed estimate of <i>p</i> with variance <i>σ</i><sup>2</sup>.
  </ol>
  <p>
    The first two assumptions hold in the aggregate regardless of the random structure
    on the individual scale, as long as that randomness is independent and
    there are enough people in each statistical segment.
    Decomposing this sum as a sum of Bernoulli variables is just a convenient
    way to analyze its behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    What about the third assumption?
    In the US, most pollsters have an empirically-detectable left- or right-leaning bias.
    Different polling methodologies also introduce bias, like using landlines
    (more likely to include older voters) or polling all registered voters instead of likely voters
    (more likely to include younger voters).
    When we talk about the polling mean and polling variance, then,
    we're talking about a statistical model that weights polls and corrects
    for these effects, such as the ones by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even using these models on well-studied elections with a lot of polling data,
    our estimate of <i>p</i> has error bars on the order of &pm;2-4%, justifying "constant variance".
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we should consider whether the asymptotic analysis above loses
    too many constant factors to be of practical use.
    The easiest way to do that is to note where we gain and lose these factors
    and their rough order of magnitude:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>There's a factor of 1/&Sqrt;(2<i>&pi;</i>) from Stirling's approximation: <b>-0.5 magnitudes</b>.</li>
    <li>There's a factor of 1/<i>e</i><sup>2</sup> from substituting for <i>&epsilon;</i> in the term above: <b>-1 magnitude</b>.</li>
    <li>There's a factor of 1/&Sqrt;(2<i>&pi;&sigma;<sup>2</sup></i>) in the density function. If &sigma; ~ 2-4%: <b>+1 magnitude</b>.</li>
    <li>High turnout is still just a third of the governed population: <b>+0.5 magnitudes</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These corrections roughly cancel out.
    I think 1/<i>n</i> is a good estimate for the chance that a single vote
    changes the outcome of a race with a polling mean around 48-52% and an
    error bars around 2-4%.
  </p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    This analysis suggests for an altrustic voter (that is, a voter who cares
    about outcomes for everyone in their city, state, and country), voting is
    roughly equally effective at all levels of government.
    Since elections cause the reallocation of thousands of dollars per voter,
    a 1/<i>n</i> chance of changing the outcome implies high social impact.
    That's similar to the results of the 80,000 Hours post, even though we
    arrived at them in a different way.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you live in a swing state, vote!
    If any other races on your ballot are competitive, vote!
    And even if the winners are all but decided, vote -
    it's good to develop the habit.
  </p>
